I followed this [amazing guide from J McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to build this static website hosted on github pages. Once I had my basic website running, I started to do some edits, but eventually I got tired of making a thousand commits to test different css styles. To test changes to the website avoiding the deploy time in github, I attempted to run it locally: for this I needed Jekyll and Ruby and Gems bundles. The specific requirements to test github pages are in this [github list](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#prerequisites) & [this jekyll list](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). I tried to install each element separately but I encountered several issues, and then I found a [repo](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/making-github-pages-work-with-latest-jekyll/) by Moncef Belyamani from which you can install everything in one step! Thanks internet people for sharing content like this ðŸ¥°.

In summary,

1. To create a simple github pages, clone [this repo](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io) and follow [this guideline to understand the repo structure.](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

2. To run your site locally, install ruby, gems and Jekyll from [this repo](https://github.com/monfresh/install-ruby-on-macos)

3. Create new Jekyll website as shown on [this documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). Note that when you create this project, you will see two files in the project folder: Gemfile and Gemfile.lock

4. **Copy and paste these two Gemfiles into your github pages project folder**. While you're on your github pages folder, run jekyll serve on your terminal. Your local site will be running on this server:  Server address: [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) unless you specified any other port in the config yml file or in the jekyll serve statement.


And now I'm able to run my github pages locally ðŸ¥³ <br><br>
