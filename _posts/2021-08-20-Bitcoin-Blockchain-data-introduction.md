This post follows a [notebook I made on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/statsfromarg/btc-blockchain-data-exploratory-analysis) as a first exploratory approach to understanding Bitcoin blockchain data. The goal of this EDA is to become familiarized with the blockchain data structure, and where to find information about blocks, transactions and addresses.

Bitcoin blockchain data at BigQuery is stored in two main tables - blocks and transactions, within transactions there are two nested tables, inputs and outputs.

To start exploring blockchain data I extracted the first rows of all four tables, mapped each field with its meaning, and made some aggregates to get insights.

* [**Blocks**](#blocks), I visualized number and size of blocks by month, since 2009.
* [**Transactions**](#txns) I analyze one transaction to understand how transactions, inputs and outputs are linked (Pending to do)  
* [**Inputs & Outputs**](#outputs) Extract the current number of unspent btc. (Pending to do)

* **number**: The number of the block
* **version**: Protocol version specified in block header
* **merkle_root**: The root node of a Merkle tree, where leaves are transaction hashes
* **timestamp**: Block creation timestamp specified in block header
* **timestamp_month**: Month of Block creation timestamp specified in block header
* **nonce**: Difficulty solution specified in block header

### Transactions <a name="txns"></a>

Exploring Transactions table, ignoring the nested tables inputs and outputs.

* **hash**: The hash of this transaction
* **size**: The size of this transaction in bytes
* **virtual_size**: The virtual transaction size (differs from size for witness transactions)
* **version**: Protocol version specified in block which contained this transaction
* **lock_time**: Earliest time that miners can include the transaction in their hashing of the Merkle root to attach it in the latest block of the blockchain
* **block_hash**: Hash of the block which contains this transaction
* **block_number**: Number of the block which contains this transaction
* **block_timestamp**: Timestamp of the block which contains this transaction
* **block_timestamp_month**: Month of the block which contains this transaction
* **input_count**: The number of inputs in the transaction
* **output_count**: The number of outputs in the transaction
* **input_value**: "Total value of inputs in the transaction
* **output_value**: Total value of outputs in the transaction
* **is_coinbase**: true if this transaction is a coinbase transaction
* **fee**: The fee paid by this transaction
* **inputs**: This includes a json formatted field with all the variables in the Inputs table, which is explored later in the notebook.
* **outputs**: Also json field with all the outputs, explored later as well.

Without those nested tables, there's no much "transaction" information you can get. For example, for the first transaction, we can see it is_coinbase = True since it's the first transaction included in a block, and the output value of 5000000000, in sats, was the 50 BTC reward for processing a block back in 2009. Checking Bitcoin Explorer, using the transaction hash, we can see the same info + some info about output (the address that it was sent to).

**Exploring a specific transaction**

The above-mentioned transaction was the first one, and involves 50 btc that have never been spent.
To better understand the anatomy of a more typical transaction, let's see how bitcoins are spent.

Take for example the hash `4ce18f49ba153a51bcda9bb80d7f978e3de6e81b5fc326f00465464530c052f4`. This one has two outputs - one is unspent (available balance for the hodler) and the other one is spent in the transaction with the hash `9a9294fec01d85438d1ecbdfce636b26e896b7a307fd448c3b2e224ef4bf2bae`. This one, in turn, also has two outputs, one spent and one unspent. I know this
