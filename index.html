  Hi! I'm Camila and this is a static Jekyll website about my craft :) and random stuff. I'm a statistician working towards financial inclusion and ending poverty (the SDGs goal #1).
  Right now I'm a grad student at UT 🤘🏻 and I'm trying to learn more about computation and data science. Since I learn much better when I write things down, I'll be adding some notes and resources here. I hope you don't mind. <a href="/blog_en">Here's what I've got so far.</a></p>
