I"n@<p>This post follows a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/statsfromarg/btc-blockchain-data-exploratory-analysis">notebook I made on Kaggle</a> as an exploratory approach to Bitcoin Blockchain data. The goal of this EDA is to become familiarized with blockchain data structure, and where to find information about blocks, transactions, inputs and output - the main elements of the blockchain.</p>

<p>The highest level are the blocks, blocks are containers of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a link to the previous block (this is how they are chained)</li>
  <li>metadata about the block itself (size, timestamp)</li>
  <li>transaction data stored in a Merkle Tree structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second level are transactions, which are related to a block by the block hash, and contain aggregate information about the amounts sent in a typical bitcoin transaction. Since each transaction can have multiple inputs and outputs, there are two nested tables within transaction table that provide the highest detail of a transaction. With inputs and outputs table, you can see how much bitcoin was sent in satoshis, how much was received, how much was used for fees, the origin of each input and the recipient(s) of each transaction.</p>

<p>The transactions can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coinbase transactions: transactions with no inputs, created from mining</li>
  <li>Typical transactions: in which the input includes 1 or more sources from were the amount was gathered to be sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, an important concept for bitcoin is the UTXO model: in this model, all the ‚Äúavailable‚Äù bitcoin is the bitcoin that has not been spent. So if a transaction with an output with a specific hash, for example 123, is not used as an input in any other transaction, it means that the bitcoin is available to be spent. Otherwise, any bitcoin that is used as an input is bitcoin that has been spent and is never used again.</p>

<p>Altogether, there are four tables on Big Query:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#blocks">Blocks</a></li>
  <li><a href="#txns">Transactions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#inputs">Inputs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#outputs">Outputs</a></li>
</ol>

<p>To explore Blocks table, I extract the average size by month since 2009 and plot its distribution through time. To understand transaction table, I explore the first recorded transaction, and to understand how inputs and outputs are used, I analyze the pizza transaction üçï.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I currently use two ways to use BigQuery - kaggle and python. There are plenty of tutorials for python and BigQuery, so here I‚Äôll just share the chunk needed to access it through <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/bigquery/bitcoin-blockchain">kaggle</a>.</p>

<p>Without those nested tables, there‚Äôs no much ‚Äútransaction‚Äù information you can get, other than the timestamp, the output value in satoshis, and a flag if it‚Äôs coinbase or not. Coinbase = True means that it is the first transaction included in a block, that is, the one is created for mining. We can use the hash and go online and explore a transaction.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Exploring a specific transaction</strong></p>

<p>The previously mentioned transaction was the first one, and involves 50 btc that have never been spent, so it has no input (was created from mining) and no linked transaction after that (never spent). To go deeper into a more typical transaction that has inputs and outputs, we need the nested tables inputs and outputs.</p>

<p>A good example for is the üçï transaction, with hash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d</code> we can pull information from the three tables. The pizza transaction is the first known use of Bitcoin to buy delicious food. It was broadcasted to the network on May 22, 2010, after Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 for two pizzas.</p>

<p>Here we get 133 rows - for just two transactions! Let‚Äôs analyze some information we get from this table:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There are 131 rows that have a txn_hash starting with a1075‚Ä¶ these are the <em>inputs</em> of the pizza purchase. This means that the pizza eater pulled coins from 131 different sources, adding up to 10,000 BTC, which were sent to only one address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The input count is 131 (gathering from 131 sources) and the output count is just 1 (sent to just one address).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transaction input value is 1000099000000, because it‚Äôs including the fee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transaction output is 1000000000000, because the recipient doesn‚Äôt receive the fee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two rows that have a txn_hash starting with cca750‚Ä¶ this transaction is what the recipient of the 10,000 did: he split the 10K in two addresses, sending 577700000000 to one and 422300000000 to the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see how each transaction is linked to the other, in these two rows the nested_hash shows the input of the transaction, which is the hash a1075‚Ä¶ - the pizza transaction.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Mapping the elements of the inputs and outputs table with concrete transactions was my only method to understand what each table contains. After mapping the most essential fields with its meaning, it could be possible to actually analyze Bitcoin Blockchain data.</p>
