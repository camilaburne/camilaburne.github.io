I"∏<p>I made this post to share documents, resources and reccommendations about my Fulbright application to study a master‚Äôs/Phd in the US.</p>

<p>The Fulbright application is similar to the real college application - you have to provide your resume, your academic transcript, english exams and two essays.</p>

<p>A typical Fulbright scholar has done research in its field of study, which is either STEM, LLM or Education, has impressive work experience or perfect academic history. Usually when you apply, you already have finished your degree and you have your resume built already - the challenge is writing the essays.</p>

<p>This essay was a more personal narration of how I became interested in my field (unexpectedly) and how I quickly made a lot of achievements in the use of data science to aid vulnerable populations (P1, P2 &amp; P3). I think in P4 I further discussed the topic of my research (GIS), and in P5 the potential uses cases for Argentina in this field:</p>

<p>This essay should be about the future, what‚Äôs your research plan and how you will apply your learnings back in Argentina.
My Study Objectives essay was chronollogically structured, showing in (P1 &amp; P2) how I gained some experience in my area of research, in what direction I‚Äôm planning to do research (P3) and how it can be applied in my homecountry (P4 &amp; P5) in the future:</p>

<p>P1) ‚ÄúAs a statistician, I had the fortune to work in different countries using data and technology to provide solutions to end poverty and drive inclusion‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>P2) ‚ÄúThis experience showed me how critical it is to properly grasp the complexities of the problem being addressed before attempting a solution. I continued working towards the goal of fighting poverty, starting with measuring and estimating. I predicted income in Buenos Aires through‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>P3) ‚ÄúMy interest in geographic information systems (GIS) evolved when I joined the United Nations (UN) as a consultant, using satellite images for climate change research‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
