I"Z<p>Anomaly or outlier detection is the search of atypical observations that don’t seem to fit with a pattern found in the majority of data. To start an anomaly detection project is tricky, because usually the source data is not labelled as ‘anomaly’/’non-anomaly’, so unsupervised methods are the go-to method to identify outliers.</p>
