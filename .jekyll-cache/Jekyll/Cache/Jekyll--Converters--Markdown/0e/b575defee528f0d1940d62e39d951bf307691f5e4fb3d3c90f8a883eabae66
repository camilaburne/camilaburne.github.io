I"ý<p>Iâ€™m in the ongoing process of setting up my new MacBook Air (M1, 2020) for my data analytics projects plus grad-school homework, so I need a very <em>average</em> set up of Homebrew, Python, Pyenv, Jupyterlab, R; on top of some simple things for my blog like Jekyll and Ruby. While doing this, Iâ€™ve been encountering issues - mainly because of incompatibilities with python libraries that are not yet updated. Iâ€™ll be logging these issues and hopefully whatever workaround I found to solve them.</p>
