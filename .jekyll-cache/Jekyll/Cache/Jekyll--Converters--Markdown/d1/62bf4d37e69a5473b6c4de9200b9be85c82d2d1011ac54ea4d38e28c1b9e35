<p>Hice este post para compartir recursos y consejos para que como argentinos puedas estudiar una maestr√≠a o un doctorado en Estados Unidos <strong>gratis</strong>. El programa Fulbright
Ofrece becas para m√°s de 135 pa√≠ses, y cada oficina de pa√≠s lleva a cabo un proceso anual para elegir a sus candidatos. <a href="http://fulbright.edu.ar/course/beca-master-y-doctorado/#:~:text=Requisitos%20generales,-Las%20becas%20son&amp;text=Las%20becas%20est%C3%A1n%20restringidas%20a,Unidos%20por%20per%C3%ADodos%20prolongados%20anteriormente.">La convocatoria</a> es a principio de a√±o, en Marzo/Abril, y aplicar es bastante f√°cil - yo me tard√© tres d√≠as.</p>

<p>La convocatoria de Fulbright es muy similar al proceso de admisi√≥n de las universidades: ten√©s que enviar tu curr√≠culum vitae, expediente acad√©mico, aprobar un examen de ingl√©s v√°lido (TOEFL, por ejemplo) y redactar dos ensayos.</p>

<p>Por lo que v√≠ entre los Fulbrighters, un caso t√≠pico que se gana la beca Fulbright es alquien que pudo haber hecho: investigaci√≥n en su campo de estudio,<em>o</em> tiene una experiencia laboral impresionante <em>o</em> un historial acad√©mico perfecto. Por lo general, cuando present√°s su solicitud, ya terminaste tu carrera y ten√©s tu curr√≠culum armado, as√≠ que la √∫nica oportunidad que queda para demostrar que sos candidato perfecto es a trav√©s de los ensayos. Hay dos: un Statement of Porpose y un Study Objectives. Como todo se escribe y es en ingl√©s, compart fragmentos de lo que escrib√≠ para estos dos ensayos en ingl√©s.</p>

<h2 id="my-fulbright-statement-of-purpose-essay">My Fulbright Statement of Purpose Essay</h2>
<p>The SOP is a personal narration of how I discovered a talent for statistics and how I applied it to my personal goals of aiding the most vulnerable. I opened my essay sharing how I (unexpectedly) became interested in my field of study, to then make great achievements in the use of data and statistics to aid vulnerable populations. Then I briefly mentioned the topic of my research (GIS), and in the last paragrah, the potential benefits this technology can bring to Argentina.</p>

<p>The openings of each paragraph show the structure of the essay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>P1) ‚ÄúGrowing up in the slums, where going to university was not a rule, I did not have expectations about college ‚Äî yet I‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P2) ‚ÄúThat is how I joined my first data-related experience, becoming part of a European Union research to make improvements in‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P3) ‚ÄúSince then, my professional career took an exponential growth: from studying in Argentina and Chile, I worked for‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P4) I lost this paragraph - I‚Äôm sorry :) But I mentioned that in my UN job I realized how GIS data is available and inexpensive and countries could use them to draw national statistics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P5) ‚ÄúThere has never been a more critical time for governments and organizations to profit from the resources made available by satellite images‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-fulbright-study-objectives-essay">My Fulbright Study Objectives Essay</h2>

<p>This essay should be about the future, what‚Äôs your research plan and how you will apply your learnings back in your homecountry.
My Study Objectives essay was chronollogically structured, showing in the beginning how I gained some experience in my area of research, in what direction I‚Äôm planning to do research (3rd paragraph) and in the closing paragraphs, how this research has practical applications that can be applied in my homecountry in the future:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>P1) ‚ÄúAs a statistician, I had the fortune to work in different countries using data and technology to provide solutions to end poverty and drive inclusion‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P2) ‚ÄúThis experience showed me how critical it is to properly grasp the complexities of the problem being addressed before attempting a solution. I continued working towards the goal of fighting poverty, starting with measuring and estimating. I predicted income in Buenos Aires through‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P3) ‚ÄúMy interest in geographic information systems (GIS) evolved when I joined the United Nations (UN) as a consultant, using satellite images for climate change research‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P4) ‚ÄúTo be at the forefront of projects that aim to measure poverty in Argentina, I intend to join the Master‚Äôs to be prepared for the challenge of‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P5) ‚ÄúMy long term life mission is to contribute to assuring social and economic conditions that allow people to live with basic human rights and‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you may see, there is a small overlap in both Statement of Purpose and Study Objectives. Although in both of them I mention my background and my personal goals - in the first essay I‚Äôm mostly focused on describing my past and how I became interested in my field of study and further research; while in the second essay I go more into detail about the program I want to pursue and the practical applications of this field of study.</p>

<p>To write your essays, I strongly suggest learning what‚Äôs the structure of essays used in college applications. Fulbright application it‚Äôs just a mock application to graduate school.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr1OXIS8cjY">Structure of a Statement of Purpose (video)</a>
This video was super useful to me, I ended up writing my essays in this style ang getting acceptances from all colleges! (but one). The reccommended structure:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Introduce who you are</li>
  <li>Detail about your academic and technical interest (or work experience)</li>
  <li>Future academic goals - your future in the department. Connect your interest with your goal.</li>
  <li>Short and long term goals - what you will achieve with this program.</li>
  <li>Praise the program</li>
</ol>

<p>Other useful resources is to directly read statements that students used to get admitted to top schools. I found more videos than written content, but it‚Äôs still great guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjhSbp2JWp4">Reading of MIT SOP in City Planning (video)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFc-MawCIDI">Reading of very personal Harvard SOP, Masters in Education (video)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, your application should be proof-read by other people who can give you useful feedback. If (like me) you don‚Äôt have friends in grad school who can help out, try asking on reddit for help, it always helps!</p>

  <li>And any subreddit of the school you want to attend</li>
</ul>
