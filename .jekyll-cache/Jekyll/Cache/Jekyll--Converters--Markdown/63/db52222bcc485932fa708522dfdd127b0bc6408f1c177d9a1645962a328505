I"<p>Iâ€™m in the ongoing process of setting up my new MacBook Air (M1, 2020) for my data analytics projects plus grad-school homework, so I need a very average set up of Homebrew, Python, Pyenv, Jupyterlab, R; on top of some simple things for my blog like Jekyll and Ruby.   and the issues I encounter - mainly because of incompatibilities with packages that are not yet updated.</p>
