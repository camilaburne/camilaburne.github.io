I"9<p>I followed this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">amazing guide from J McGlone</a> to build this static website hosted on github pages. Once I had my basic website running, I started to do some edits, but eventually I got tired of making a thousand commits to test different css styles. To test changes to the website avoiding the deploy time in github, I attempted to run it locally: for this I needed Jekyll and Ruby and Gems bundles. The specific requirements to test github pages are in this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#prerequisites">github list</a> &amp; <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">this jekyll list</a>. I tried to install each element separately but I encountered several issues, and then I found a <a href="https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/making-github-pages-work-with-latest-jekyll/">repo</a> by Moncef Belyamani from which you can install everything in one step! Thanks people on the internet for sharing content like this ðŸ¥°.</p>
